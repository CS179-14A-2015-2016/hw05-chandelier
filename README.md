HW05 â€” Pong Reloaded (deadline: 2015-10-08)
===

Rework your HW02 in C++ (or other toolkits for non-CS people) with the following implemented:

* Implement vector classes.
  * Reimplement them even if the toolkit/framework has them already.
  * Do not copy from a library.
* Computations should be done with vector math as much as possible.
* The speed of the bounced ball should depend on the paddle's speed when the ball hits it.
* The direction of the bounced ball should slightly depend where the ball hits the paddle.
* Two balls on screen that bounces off each other.
